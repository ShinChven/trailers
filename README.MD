# To dear movie lovers

This app is basically a trailer info tracker, I built this app to help myself get updated of the latest released movie trailers. I hope you guys can also enjoy it.

## How does it work

- This app will fetch trailer info from the internet so that you can browse the latest released movie trailer info.
- But the app itself does not provide any steam video, due to limited resources.
- However the app will forward you to search trailers in popular video platforms.

## How to watch the trailer

- By tapping on the trailer item, the app will forward you to search the trailer in YouTube.
- By long pressing on the trailer item, you can choose other optional platforms to search the trailer.

## Extra function

- This app can help you add movie's release date to your calendar.

## Copyright

- All movies' info and media that are showed in this app are copyrighted by their creators.
- All trailers you found through this app are copyrighted by their creators or hosting platforms.

## Privacy and permission

- All data will stay in your phone.

## Localization

This app will only be offered in English version for the moment. And all movie's release date are set for US only.
